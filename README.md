# Data Science Resources application in Streamlit

This application was inspired by my students and those I have helped to mentor over the years. There are so many data science tools and resources to use scattered across different places. This was an attempt to create a central location to find resources and get started understanding the data science landscape. I have plans to continue adding to this app in the future.
